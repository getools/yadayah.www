#
# Sweeps for stale lock state that admin-recordings.php's in_progress signal
# would otherwise treat as still active. Runs every minute. Three classes:
#
#   1. Heartbeat files (/tmp/recording_active_<key>) older than 30s.
#      The popout heartbeats every 5s; mtime > 30s means the popout closed
#      ungracefully (browser crash, OS sleep, network drop) and never got
#      its release beacon out. admin-recordings.php cleans these inline as
#      it encounters them, but only for items it actually queries — this
#      sweep catches the rest.
#
#   2. Finalize worker state (/tmp/finalize_<key>.state) in terminal status
#      (complete/error/idle) older than 1 hour, plus any orphaned
#      .progress / .duration sidecars older than 1 hour. The worker writes
#      its terminal status and exits; nothing else cleans these up.
#
#   3. Transcript jobs (yy_feed_item_transcript_job) stuck in pending or
#      running for >2 hours with no PID alive. These would otherwise hold
#      an item's in_progress lock forever once the worker crashed.
#
# All operations are idempotent; safe to run as often as desired.
